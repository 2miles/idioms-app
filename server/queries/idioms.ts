/**
 * Builds a SQL query to fetch a paginated and optionally filtered list of idioms,
 * ordered by any allowed field (e.g. timestamps DESC). Each idiom is assigned a
 * global position based on its true ranking in the full dataset, even when filters are applied.
 *
 * Query breakdown:
 * 1. `global_total`: counts all idioms (unfiltered).
 * 2. `ranked_all`: assigns a global row number to all idioms ordered by timestamp DESC.
 * 3. `filtered`: optionally filters the ranked idioms and calculates their global position using: (total + 1 - row_num).
 * 4. Final SELECT returns a page of idioms with their correct global positions.
 *
 * This allows users to search/sort idioms and still see the idiom's position in the full unfiltered list.
